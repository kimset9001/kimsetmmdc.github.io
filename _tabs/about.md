## About Me

Hi there! I'm Eliakim, a first year student at Mapua Malayan Digital Colleges, taking BS in Information Technology majoring in Software Development. I'm super excited about using technology to solve problems, especially when it comes to protecting our planet.

I've always been amazed by birds, and the Philippine eagle, in particular, has a special place in my heart. It's more than just a bird to me - it's a symbol of nature's beauty and Philippine's heritage but these incredible eagles are in risk of extinction, and I want to do whatever I can to help save them.

I started this website for a school project, but it's grown into something more for me. It's a way to share my passion for nature and tell the world about the importance of saving the Philippine eagle. I believe that we can use technology to spread the word and make a real difference.

The eagles are in trouble because of human activities such as deforestation and shooting but they're not the only ones affected by these issues. Our environment is at risk, and that matters to all of us. It's not just about saving one species of bird but about making sure our whole ecosystem is healthy and balanced.

If you're reading this, I want you to be a part of this journey. There are lots of ways we can help the eagles and the environment, from being careful about how we live to supporting organizations doing great work. Together, I know we can create a world where nature's voice is heard loud and clear.

Want to get involved or share your ideas? Don't hesitate to contact me. This is a team effort, and your contribution counts!
