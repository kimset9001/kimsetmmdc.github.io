The Philippine Eagle, scientifically known as Pithecophaga jefferyi, is a magnificent and unique bird of prey endemic to the Philippines. This eagle is a symbol of the Philippines's natural heritage. This majestic bird of prey is facing critical endangerment, and its survival is threatened by a combination of factors:

## **Habitat Loss and Deforestation** 

![Deforestation](https://images.gmanews.tv/webpics/2019/05/MINING2_2019_05_09_19_46_38.jpg)_Source: https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/publicaffairs/borntobewild/693892/born-to-be-wild-visits-some-of-the-remaining-forests-in-the-philippines/story/_

One of the fundamental issues contributing to the decline of the Philippine Eagle is habitat loss. The eagles require large forested territories, rapidly disappearing due to deforestation and land development. This loss of suitable habitat reduces their ability to find food and establish territories.[^footnote]

## **Hunting and Poaching**

Every year, there is at least one of the Philippine eagle died due to shooting. While there is increasing deforestation in their habitat, Philippine eagles go farther and farther from their customary hunting areas to search preys to hunt. This lead them into the proximity with human settlements and livestocks, resutling with conflict where the Philippine eagle frequently suffers the consequences. [^fn-nth-2]

## **Illegal Wildlife Trade**

Not only the Philippine eagle suffers from the illegal wildlife trade but also other animals. As a consequence of this illegal wildlife trade, ecosystems are severely impacted and predator-prey relationship will disrupted, causing suffering to to the various species involved, including eagles, which are often targeted by the wildlife traffickers due to their majestic apperance.

## **Climate Change and Habitat Degredation**

![Climate Change](https://serp-p.pids.gov.ph/media/featured-image/1666684927_635797ff9bc29.jpg)_Source: https://serp-p.pids.gov.ph/feature/public/index-view?feauredtype_id=1&slug=climate-crisis_

The Philippine eagle is facing the negative effects of climate change, primarily through changing weather patterns. These changes in climate have a negative impact on the tropical forests, which are the natural habitat of these eagles. As a result, the eagles' prey, which rely on specific environmental conditions, are forced to adjust their eating habits and relocate to different areas to find suitable food sources. This shifting of prey resources results in the scarcity of food for the Philippine eagles.[^fn-nth-4]

## **Electrocution**

In December 2018, a juvenile Philippine eagle was found dead in Arakan, North Cotabato due to electrocution from contact with an electric post within the protected forest. Tragically, this incident is not isolated, as other wildlife species in the area have also suffered accidental electrocution from similar power poles within protected forests.This incident underscores the significant threat of electrocution to wildlife in protected forests.

## **Disease**

The presence of Avian Influenza (bird flu) Bird flu, particularly Type A H5N1, is highly contagious and lethal to birds, including the critically endangered Philippine Eagle. There is a significant concern that this disease could potentially lead to the extinction of the Philippine Eagle. [^fn-nth-6]

## **Pollution**

The Philippine Eagle is also susceptible to the dangerous effects of pollution, including the consequences of mining activities and forest fragmentation. As predators, these eagles areo on the top of the food chain, making them highly vulnerable to the accumulation of toxins, including pesticides, in their prey species. [^fn-nth-7]

## **Human-Wildlife Conflict**

As deforestation continues, the Philippine eagles are pushed away to seek prey farther from their habitats resulting them close to the human settlements which can result in conflict with local communites. In these conflict, Philippine Eagle often finds itself at a disadvantage, as it may prey on livestock, creating tensions between these eagle and the human populations that depend on their animals for livelihood and sustenance.
