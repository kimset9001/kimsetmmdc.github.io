## **About**

#### The Philippine Eagle is one of the worldâ€™s largest, most powerful birds of prey

Philippine Eagle _(Pithecophaga jefferyi)_ is a critically endangered species of eagle that is previously recognized as the Monkey-eating Eagle due to reports from locals suggesting that it exclusively preyed on monkeys. Subsequent studies have disproven this belief, revealing that the species has a more diverse diet that includes animals such as rodents, bats, pigs, and monitor lizards. Philippine eagles are known for their monogamous behavior and lifelong mating, except in the case of the death of one partner. Their extended breeding cycle spans two years, during which both the male and female share the responsibility of parenting for a total of 20 months.

These majestic birds are native to the Philippines and have experienced a significant and ongoing decline in their population, raising concerns of near-extinction over the past four decades. Recognizing this dire situation, the Philippine eagle recently earned the distinction of being the National Bird of the Philippines, contributing to increased awareness of the species and its conservation challenges. The survival of these eagles is under threat due to factors like diminishing and fragmented habitat, activities such as commercial timber extraction and expanding agriculture, mining operations, uncontrolled hunting, pesticide buildup, and exposure to severe weather events.

## **Population**

#### Population Status: <span style="color: red;">Critically Endangered</span>
Philippine eagle faces constant threats from human actions, with least of these eagle falling victim to shooting each year. With the ongoing deforestation, Philippine eagles go farther and farther from their usual hunting grounds in search for preys to hunt. Including the destruction of nesting sites due to deforestation, accidental capture in traps set for wild pigs, and illegal hunting by farmers in retaliation for predation on domestic animals and livestock.

#### Population: <span style="color: red;">400 Pairs</span>

Philippine eagle considered as one of the largest and most formidable forest raptors, and it's critically endangered according to the IUCN, with an estimated remaining population of just 400 pairs in the wild. [^fn-nth-2] 

Depending on the number of prey in the area, a pair of Philippine eagles requires roughly 4000-11000 hectares of forest land to flourish in the wild. [^fn-nth-3]

#### Population Threats: <span style="color: red;">Human Activities</span>

The primary threats to Philippine eagles stem from deforestation caused by **logging** and the **expansion of agriculture**. **Old-growth forests are rapidly disappearing**, particularly in lowland areas dominated by logging companies. In addition to **deforestation**, significant hazards include **mining**, **pollution**, **exposure to pesticides that impact breeding**, and **poaching**. Furthermore, Philippine eagles can sometimes become unintended casualties in **traps** set by local individuals targeting deer. [^fn-nth-4] [^fn-nth-5]

Philippine eagles inhabit just four out of the Philippines' 6,000+ islands: **Luzon**, **Samar**, **Leyte**, and **Mindanao**. They thrive in primary forests found in both lowland and mid-elevation areas. Unfortunately, a significant portion of these habitats has been cleared due to development and logging, pushing many eagles to higher mountainous regions. 

## **Diet and Nutrition**

Philippine eagles are carnivorous predators with a diverse diet. They primarily prey on monkeys, birds, flying foxes, giant cloud-rats, Asian palm civets, flying squirrels, tree squirrels, fruit bats, and reptiles such as large snakes and lizards. Additionally, they are known to hunt other birds of prey, and in certain locations, they may capture flying lemurs. These formidable eagles have even been documented catching young pigs and small dogs for sustenance. [^fn-nth-6]

#### **Mating System:** Monogamous

_Pithecophaga jefferyi_ mates for life, and when one partner passes away, it's common for the eagle to seek a new mate. The natural breeding cycle spans two years, with successful pairs producing one offspring every two years. Breeding season runs from October to December to ensure the chick hatches during the dry season (February to May). The chick hatches after 60 days, becomes a fledgling at 7 to 8 weeks, and achieves independence at 5 months. Females reach sexual maturity at 3 to 5 years, while males reach maturity at 4 to 7 years.

## **Did You Know?** [^fn-nth-8] [^fn-nth-9]

> **Rarity and Power:** Renowned for its rarity and impressive power, the Philippine eagle is a sought-after sight for birdwatchers around the world.

> **Legal Protection:** In the Philippines, killing a Philippine eagle is a serious offense, carrying severe penalties of up to 12 years in prison and substantial fines.

> **The 'Monkey-Eating':** Initially referred to as the 'monkey-eating eagle,' this majestic bird earned its name due to early misconceptions. Natives in Bonga, Samar, where the species was first encountered, believed it exclusively preyed on monkeys. This led to its scientific name, derived from the Greek words pithecus (Ï€Î¯Î¸Î·ÎºÎ¿Ï‚) ("ape or monkey") and phagus (-Ï†Î¬Î³Î¿Ï‚) ("eater of")

> **Many Names:** Besides its official name, the Philippine eagle goes by various monikers in different Philippine languages, including "Ã¡guila" (eagle), "hÃ¡ribon" (meaning "king bird"), and "banog" (kite).

> **Unique Behavior:** The female Philippine eagle displays unique behaviors, such as fasting and increased water consumption around 8 to 10 days before egg-laying. During this time, she holds her wings droopingly.

> **The Blue-Eyed Hunter:** This bird of prey is the only one in the world with blue eyes. Their remarkable vision, eight times sharper than that of humans, makes them extraordinary hunters.

> **Monogamous and loyal:** it is known for its monogamous and steadfast nature. Once they form a partnership, these eagles remain devoted to each other for life. When it comes to raising their young, the Philippine eagle follows a deliberate pattern, laying just one egg every two years. Before considering another, the parents ensure their offspring can survive on their own.

> **A British naturalist discovered the Philippine eagle:** The discovery of the Philippine eagle can be attributed to British naturalist and explorer John Whitehead. In 1896, during an expedition in Paranas, Samar, he encountered this remarkable bird. In honor of his father, who had funded his explorations, the eagle was given its scientific name, 'Pithecophaga jefferyi,' with 'jefferyi' paying tribute to Jeffrey, John Whitehead's father.
